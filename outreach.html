                                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                                    There was a lack of menstrual products on campus, hampering student's ability to gain a full educational experience while at Berkeley.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h4>Process</h4>
                                    I researched what other universities, cities, and companies did to offer menstrual products as well as the costs associated with offering a free service. I
                                    kickstarted and oversaw the crowdfunding campaign to develop the infrastructure to make restocking easier. I lead, as president of the engineering student council, a team to negotiate with each campus building manager access to place bins in the womxn-identifying/gender-neutral restrooms.

                                    <ul>
                                        <li> <h5>Raised $1,767 through crowdfunding efforts </h5>
                                                <p> These funds allowed us to look and test out different bins to find the one that does not jam and has space for most menstrual product types. </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li> <h5>Expanded to 8+ restrooms </h5>
                                                <p> Due to popularity as well as efficiency to expand, the initiative was set up in 8 womxn-identifying restrooms in the first month of operation with plans for expansion before Covid-19. </p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li> <h5>Secured $40,000 worth of product for 10 years. </h5>
                                                <p> Partnering up with another student organization as well as getting funding from the student government, I ensured that the program will be present for at lease the near future.</p>

                                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                                    Trying to understand the undergraduate experience within the College of Engineering was a daunting task. Additionally, I, as Engineering Student Council President, as well as Dean's office found it difficult to make sure that majority, if not all, students are supported by the college.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h4>Process</h4>
                                    Holding townhalls and public forums, I and my team gathered feedback and advice on the structure of the commitee. I met with student identify groups to gain their perspective on this structure as well as hear their stories on how to better support them and their fellow students. 
                                    I worked with the Associate Dean for Equity and Inclusion to have this committee have a place at the College's Faculty Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Council.

                                    <h4>Problem</h4>
                                    This event gives elementary and middle school students from around the Bay Area a taste of what it is like to be an engineer. 
                                    Due to the cost and resources needed to plan this event, it was going to be postponed/cancelled until I stepped in. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    <h4>Process</h4>
                                    As I was also overseeing the planning of Engineers Week, a national weeklong event held by universities across the US, I added this event as the final day of this week. I worked with more than 5 student organizations
                                    to host events, reserve spaces throughout the campus, found a guest speaker, as well as plan the food iternary for this event. To ensure this event can be held in the future, I worked with the organization that originally hosted
                                    this event to merge their organization into my organization, the Engineering Student Council.

                                        <li> <h5>More than 200 attendees </h5>
                                                <p>I worked with the Engineering 4 Kids team to split the task of recruiting and setting up the event to ensure things run smoother.</p>

                                                <p> Due to the partnerships I made with student organizations, the college's makerspace, and college administrators, we had workshops for the parents on preparing their kids for high school and college to demonstrations on aerodynamics.</p>
                                        </li>
                                        <li> <h5>$2,000 worth of free food given away</h5>
                                                <p> Due to the fact that this event caters to those from low-income, disadvantaged areas, I wanted to have everyone fed during the event. Even with so many people in attendance, we were able to provide accommodations for people with dietary restrictions.</p>
