                      <h3> Background </h3>
                      <p> Active Track was a partner project between the UCB/UCSF Ergonomics Program and SwiftMotion. This project focused on improving the typically sedentary lifestyle of office workers using a device. This partnership focused
                      on developing as well as validating the startup's (SwiftMotion) product.
                      <h3> Key Takeaways </h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li> Validating the device against commercially available devices and MVTA (Motion Video Task Analysis)</li>
                        <li> Programmed and built a robot arm device to test the accuracy of the Active Track device over a 12 hour period. Robot Arm system is based off the CHIROID robot arm designs (can be found in my Design Portfolio)</li>
                        <li> Wrote Python scripts to analyze robot arm data (upwards of 1,000,000 data points), create .csv files, and upload to Google Sheet using Google API with </li>

                      <p>Overall course project focused on improving the adminstrative structure of the course, from attendance tracking to project team member performance. For the class, I programmed an Instagram attendance tracker. Out of 12 teams,

                        <li>Created a Python script to parse through each team's Instagram feed, pull data from posts, upload said data to Google Sheets using Google's API, and automatically note down the students present in class.</li>
                        <li>Collaborated on a participation portal for project teams to give effective feedback to their team members. Some feedback I got back from working with project team: </li>
                        <blockquote>"Niraj is the team motivator. He truly pushed us to the next level by constantly generating new ideas and potential improvements to our project. While we were not always able to implement them, the mere fact that he brought them up led us to question everything about our design and ultimately make improvements we would not have otherwise thought of." -Team member 1</blockquote>
                        <blockquote>"Niraj was great on our team and on this project. He brought interestingly unique ideas to Project 4 which we implemented. He is a creative person and loves to share his ideas. Niraj is fun to work with, really smart and works hard. If I could, I would recommend startups to hire Niraj." -IEOR 171 team member 2</blockquote>
