# Niraj's Official Website!
This website is the blood, sweat, and tears of months of work and hundreds of updates showcasing the best works of Niraj. What started off as a test of his knoweldge in HTML soon
became a full fledged project requiring a full overhaul of his original website to better reflect his expertise in areas such as 3D modeling to coding. Before reading any further and/or
forking/copying the code to this repository I would like to warn you of one major thing. It is sometimes best to not know how the magician does a trick to keep the magic alive. If you are still curious
as to how I made this website then below are the tips and tools that I used to make this website. 

## How was it built?
Using HTML5, Sass, and Javascript, I built the website by initially remaking [this front page that I found](https://html5up.net/forty) on HTML5up.net. You can really see the similarity when choosing *don't 
know where to start* on the home page. I used Sass (.scss format) with LiveCompiler in VsCode to make the main css file. For personal prefences, I did not use separate css files. One major recommendation I have 
when making a website is to use Go Live server and Automatic Save extensions in VsCode. It makes it a lot easier to see changes happening in real time. 

## Considerations on the website
Accessibility, accessibility, accessibility. Starting off with the color palette, I chose colors that had high WCAG constrast scores. Areas that might be difficult to read resulted defaulted to black and white.
Additionally, I wanted the website to load fast and have the needed configurations for search engine optimization so I added in all of the necessary meta tags. Using a color blindness tester, I verified that the website
was readable for those with color blindess of different variations.
