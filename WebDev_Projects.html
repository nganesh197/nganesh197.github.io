												<h2>Northern California Center for <br> Occupational and Environmental Health (COEH)</h2>
											</header>
                      <p>For more than 40 years, the Northern Center for Occupational and Environmental Health (COEH) and its sister centers at Los Angeles and Irvine serve government, industry, schools, health professionals, and the general public through programs and partnerships designed to deepen understanding of occupational and environmental hazards and to prevent disease, fatalities, and injuries.
                      <br><br>
                      I was hired as a Website Developer while an undergraduate at Cal to maintain and improve the web assets of the organization. As the organization heavily used their website to advertise their programs, they greatly needed a website that could be easily updated, has a low learning curve,
                      and is readable to wide range of viewers. Their old website was difficult to update, hard to adjust to COEH's branding, and burdensome for visitors to navigate.

                    <li>Website was moved from Wordpress to Wix. This was due to the comfort level of the COEH staff to use Wix over Wordpress in updating the website</li>
                    <li>A custom template was designed for COEH to align better with its branding. Additionally, template aided in properply showcasing COEH's programs. </li>
                    <li>Previously lost website information was recovered using Web archives and backed up websites. This greatly helped COEH ensure their website helped its visitors</li>

												<h2>Engineering Student Council at Berkeley</h2>
											</header>
                        <p>Founded more than 45 years ago, Engineering Student Council represents engineering student body at Berkeley. The student organization works with Berkeley Engineering on creating an equitable and inclusive climate within the college. Additionally, ESC allocates $100,000+ funds from the ASUC, ESS, and CoE to more than 50+ organizations.</p>
                        <p>Over the two years I was on the executive team, I took the opportunity to completely revamp the website's HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. Before, the website was solely used for student organizations affiliated with the ESC to apply for funding, see how much they were allocated, and request more funding. The new website focused on providing resources to both students (undergraduate and graduate) and student
                        organizations that universities struggle to provide.

                      <p> The Ergonomics Program is affiliated with the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health, a University of California umbrella organization that links faculty and research programs with
                      research interest in occupational health from the Berkeley, Davis and San Francisco campuses. The Program's laboratory is located at U.C. Berkeley's Global Campus (Richmond Field Station), a research station administered by the College of Engineering.
                      </p>
                      <p> As part of my work with the Center for Occupational and Environmental Health, I remade my laboratory's website. Primarily I worked on improving the overall aesthetics of the website as the original website was devoid of color. While reconstructing the website, I came up with
                        lab's new logo (which can be seen under Design Portfolio).
