												<h2>Free Menstrual Product Initiative</h2>
											</header>
                      <h3> Background </h3>
                      <p> The Free Menstrual Product Initiative was initially small project that grew into a full fledged venture during my last year in the Engineering Student Council. Originally, I had hoped to have a vending machine that dispensed
                      subsidized menstrual products like pads and tampons along with other school supplies such as scantrons in a visible location. The goal was to destigmatize menstruation as well as provide a case study to show the benefit of allyships. As mentioned before, the project changed to offer free menstrual products in womxn-identifying restrooms with infrastructure in place to allow for a fast expansion.
                      Right before the 2020 COVID-19 quarantine, this initiative covered eight restrooms, had secured funding for the 2020-2021 year, and had a strong backend support team.
                      </p>
                      <h3> Key Takeaways </h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li> Created a custom Google Map that could be overlaid with mobile version of Google Maps</li>
                        <li> Developed a restocking web page(<a href="https://esc.berkeley.edu/fmpi" target="_blank"> FMPI webpage </a>) so students who need a product can see which locations has what product.</li>
                        <li> Led crowdfund to obtain more than $1700 toward building the infrastructure of FMPI. Funds were allocated to purchasing reliable metal dispensers and fixing up the inventory system.</li>
                        <li> Oversaw partnership of ESC with the Coalition for the Institulization of Free Menstrual Products which gave ESC a much needed supply line.</li>

                      <h3> Background </h3>
                      <p> When I entered college as a freshmxn, I saw how problematic systemic discrimination, whether in academia, student organizations, and physical spaces, had on a students' chance to succeed in college.
                          With the Engineering Student Council team, we created this committee to achieve three goals: 1)To enable students from different backgrounds to have a voice 2)Come up with equitable solutions from an engineering perspective 3)Remove discriminatory practices in club recruitment. Unlike my other ESC project,
                        this committee was still getting its bearings by the time I left. While the success of this committee will be known in due time, the silver lining was the enthusiasm shown by graduate students to create a graduate version.
                      </p>
                      <h3> Key Takeaways </h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li> Worked with 8 undergraduate community student organizations to get buy-in. </li>
                        <li> Partnered with the College of Engineering's Faculty Equity and Inclusion Council to develop foundation of the UE&I</li>

                   <h3> Background </h3>
                   <p> Engineering 4 Kids Day at UC Berkeley is an annual one-day science and engineering education event for local fourth- to sixth-grade students. Attendees at Engineering for Kids Day engage in fun, hands-on activities led by Berkeley students from a wide range of engineering disciplines. Thanks to the generosity of volunteers and sponsors,
                     this event is completely free for all participants and families! During my time as ESC President, we oversaw the acquisition of this organization as well as host their 2020 event.
                   </p>
                   <h3> Key Learning Experiences</h3>
                   <ul>
                     <li> Berkeley Dominoes can make 70 pizzas by 11:30AM for 200 people. Also, if you account for people with dietary restrictions, remember to get a gluten-free AND vegan pizza .  </li>
                     <li> Failure will happen even if you plan for everything. The key is planning for that failure. Initially, we assumed that our reservations for 4 of the 9 total rooms would not go through in time. As a backup, we reserved 6 more rooms to account for the over 200 people in attendance.</li>
                     <li> Partnered with 6 student organizations, Jacobs Hall makerspace, and the College of Engineering to host workshops, tours, and talks.
