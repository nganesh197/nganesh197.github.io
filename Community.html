												<h2>Free Menstrual Product Initiative</h2>
											</header>
                      <h3> Background </h3>
                      <p> The Free Menstrual Product Initiative was initially small project of mine that grew into a full fledged venture during my last year in the Engineering Student Council. Originally, I had hoped to have a vending machine that dispensed
                      subsidized menstrual products like pads and tampons along with other school supplies such as scantrons in a visible location. The goal was to destigmatize menstruation as well as provide a case study to show the benefit of allyships. As mentioned before, the project changed to offer free menstrual products in womxn-identifying restrooms with infrastructure in place to allow for a fast expansion.
                      Right before the 2020 COVID-19 quarantine, this initiative covered eight restrooms, had secured funding for the 2020-2021 year, and had a strong backend support team.
                      </p>
                      <h3> Key Takeaways </h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li> Created a custom Google Map that could be overlaid with mobile version of Google Maps</li>
                        <li> Developed a restocking web page(<a href="https://esc.berkeley.edu/fmpi" target="_blank"> FMPI webpage </a>) so students who need a product can see which locations has what product.</li>
                        <li> Led crowdfund to obtain more than $1700 toward building the infrastructure of FMPI. Funds were allocated to purchasing reliable metal dispensers and fixing up the inventory system.</li>
                        <li> Oversaw partnership of ESC with the Coalition for the Institulization of Free Menstrual Products which gave ESC a much needed supply line.</li>

                      </header>
                      <h3> Background </h3>
                      <p> When I first became ESC President, I was thrown into a meeting where "exclusive" technology clubs deemed it fair that they have restrictive membership to join. Now this was not a problem that was unique to UC Berkeley, in fact, it is prevalent in most universities albeit in different fields.
                        I came up with the idea of an Undergraduate Equity and Inclusion committee to achieve three goals: 1)To enable students from different backgrounds to have a voice 2)Come up with equitable solutions from an engineering perspective 3)Remove discriminatory practices in club recruitment. Unlike my other ESC project,
                        this committee was still getting its bearings by the time I left. While the success of this committee will be known in due time, the silver lining was the starting framework to create a graduate version.
                      </p>
                      <h3> Key Takeaways </h3>
                      <ul>
                        <li> Worked with 8 undergraduate community student organizations to get buy-in. </li>
                        <li> Partnered with the College of Engineering's Faculty Equity and Inclusion Council to develop foundation of the UE&I</li>
                      </ul>
